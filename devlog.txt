 * fix map ui: scaled tween doesnt fully complete if user manually panned before changing locations
 * UI: add bgm+sfx on/off buttons, and persist their values
 * AI: dont buy when price is above median (advanced: find a place to sell before buying)
 * AI: consider trade stations for buy/sell actions too
 * fix AI: can get stuck with expensive goods and nowhere to sell-- then what? (cut losses and sell to station?)
 * UI: when hovering on factory name, mouse cursor = ?, if clicked open detail/info panel
 * graphics: posterboard cutout figures with dialog
 * graphics: ship and station images
 * fix: clean up divs left by modal dialogs closing
 * gameplay: add travel time between galaxy systems?
 * idea: inter-cluster worm holes as paid toll gates
 * idea: factions
 		- show faction zone indicators on map
 * idea: implement government taxing system (needs Factions code, and Calendar?)
 	- implement corporate tax discounts
 * improvement: implement name registry to ensure uniqueness (or just add a shit ton more names so collisions are statistically unlikely!)
 * improvement: give commodity descriptions, show tooltip when hovering?

NOTE: crammit -c crammit.yaml
